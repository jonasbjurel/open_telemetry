# TinyMPU6050
Inspired by [tockn's library](https://github.com/tockn/MPU6050_tockn) simplicity and ease of use, this implementation focuses on performance and accuracy while still being lightweight.

## Warning
While in calibration mode, *DO NOT MOVE* the sensor.

## Disclaimer
- Temperature isn't covered by this library (my personal choice);
- It's still in development.
